## Mini Code Project

This mini project is your opportunity to show us your style and thought process. Please ensure you can
talk about how and why you built the project in the way that you did. While this is an artificially small
project, we are looking for good code practices.

## Project Brief

We are looking for a tool that will allow them to enter probabilities and carry
out basic calculations. The program should also log each calculation for later analysis (No DB required,
text file is fine).

## The Calculator

The user should be able to enter two valid probabilities (0 to 1 e.g. 0.5 is valid, while 1.1 or -0.1 is not).
The user should be able to choose from the following functions:
1. CombinedWith: P(A)P(B) e.g. 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25
2. Either: P(A) + P(B) – P(A)P(B) e.g. 0.5 + 0.5 – 0.5*0.5 = 0.75

## What to build
1. Use a technology you feel comfortable with (C# / MVC / React / Angular)
2. A UI which allows users to enter two numbers, select a function, and see the result
3. A log that includes the date, type of calculation, the inputs and the result

## What we want to see
1. Maintainable code that is easy to extend
2. Some degree of tests
Be prepared to explain your choices.

## We do NOT want to see
1. User Security - Authentication / Authorization
2. Database
